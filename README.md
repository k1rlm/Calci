# Calci
Simple open-source calculator for linux terminal. 

Actually this is my first project that was written on shell because i just learn shell. I hope you'll like it:)
# How to use
Firstly, go to the directory where you save this shell script using command cd `/example/yourfile` in terminal.
Then, run this script as ./Calci.sh.
